      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Our Privacy Policy tells you what will happen to any personal data that
        you provide to us as a result of using this website. The information is
        written for the benefit of general visitors to the website – if you are
        a client of ours (or become one) we process a wider range of personal
        data and deal with a broader range of privacy-related issues. Clients
        are provided detailed information about this during the engagement
        process.
      </p>
      <h4>Personal data you provide</h4>
      <p>
        Your privacy is important to us. By providing personal information such
        as your name and e-mail address via the forms on this website, you agree
        to us contacting you with regard to the information provided.
      </p>
      <h4>How we use your personal data ​</h4>
      We use the data you provide via this website to:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Communicate with you, for example: we use contact details such as
          email address or phone number when responding to enquiries made via
          online forms
        </li>
        <li>
          Monitor website trends, for example: we may use Google Analytics to
          help us aggregate traffic so we can monitor how the website is being
          used
        </li>
        <li>
          Operate our business more effectively, for example: we seek feedback
          and use this to help improve our service
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Our ‘lawful reasons’ for processing your personal data</h4>
      <p>
        The ‘General Data Protection Regulation’ (GDPR) is the primary piece of
        legislation defining your rights over our processing of your personal
        information. The GDPR requires us to declare which of six “lawful
        reasons” we are relying on when we are processing your personal data: we
        operate on the basis of “consent” when sending newsletters (you won’t
        get sent a newsletter unless you have explicitly opted in to receive
        one)…. and we operate on the basis of “legitimate interest” when
        communicating with you in other ways (e.g. when responding to your
        enquiry).
      </p>
      <h4>Transfer of personal data</h4>
      <p>
        From time to time we may pass personal data such as your name and email
        address to other services that we use to send out newsletters and other
        communications (both electronic and print). However, your personal data
        will never be sold or transferred to an organisation outside the UK or
        the EU.
      </p>
      <h4>Questions or complaints ​</h4>
      <p>
        In the first instance we hope you will contact us directly with any
        questions or complaints (contact details are displayed prominently on
        this website). However, legal rights regarding privacy are the remit of
        the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) and you will find more
        information about how to complain here:
