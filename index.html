      <p>Take a look at some of our previous cases</p>
      <ul>
        <li data-aos="fade-right">Advised a client in the tech sector on a set aside motion when the SJE Report was challenged after a subsequent successful $bn fund raising.  Was key information withheld from the SJE, were the right questions answered and would he have reached a different view on value even if the alleged withheld information had been in his possession?  Then with the affects of Covid 19 was a set aside actually in the client’s best interest – how would the SJE value the business today?
          </li><br /><br />
          <li data-aos="fade-right">
            Advised a client in the industrial sector on springboard arguments requiring detailed work on quoted comparable companies, but back in the 1980s and earlier.  Required an insight into differing valuation methodologies applied in this period before the “invention” of the EBITDA multiples and a review of contemporaneous text books and guidance and valuation case law.
          </li><br /><br />
          <li data-aos="fade-right">
            Advised a private client on the valuation of a start up entity with a quasi-monopolistic overseas government license for the purposes of assisting a fund raising.  Successfully realized $75m to fund pre revenue expenditures on a venture set to be valued post revenue in the $5bn to $10bn.
          </li><br /><br />
          <li data-aos="fade-right">
            Advised the trustees to a family estate on the valuation of a founders’ shareholding in negotiations with a CAC 40 on a $bn dispute.   Should they accept the offer or rely upon the terms of a legal agreement and appoint an independent expert?  If they took the latter route, what were the risks or opportunities in the wording of the instruction terms, and the practical implications in terms of costs and efforts.
          </li><br /><br />
          <li data-aos="fade-right">
            Advised a private client on the valuation of his company for the purposes of UK Capital Gains Tax.
          </li><br /><br />
          <li data-aos="fade-right">Advised a private client on the valuation of its intellectual property to allow the patents to be capitalized on balance sheet.  This in turn facilitated both receiving a UK government grant and greater ease in future debt funding.</li><br /><br />
          <li data-aos="fade-right">
            Advised a FTSE 100 legal team on the valuation of numerous statutory entities that had provided intragroup guarantees.  With Covid 19, what was the fair value of these guarantees?  A deep dive on Moody defaults for the sector coupled with a contemporaneous view of underlying trading in order to robustly value the entities ahead of then entering into various restructuring arrangements through the Jersey and Luxembourg courts.
          </li><br /><br />
          <li data-aos="fade-right">Advised a private equity IT portfolio company on a claim from a Fortune 100 client for breach of contract, damages to servers and knock on contract failures.  What had caused the damage, what mitigating actions should have been put in place by the Fortune 100, how reasonable was the costs being claimed.</li>
